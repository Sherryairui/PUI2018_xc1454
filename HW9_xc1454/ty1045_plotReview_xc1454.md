## Clarity

This figure does not have the legend to explain what those color represent. You should add a legend to tell readers about the meaning of different color.


## Esthetic

The shade of blue, green, yellow is good enough for people to see different estimated total Internet subscriptions. However, it could be better if you add black margin to each PUMA region.


## Honesty

This figure shows the estimated total Internet subscriptions in PUMA fair enough. I review the plot in his code, which has the legend in it, the interval is equal, so this plot tells us about data honestly.
