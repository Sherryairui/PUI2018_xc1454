## Assignment 1 Review

Your graph looks great, and is very informative.  I would just suggest a few changes.

1) The legend is obscuring some of the graph.  If it's possible, you should optimize the legend in such a way that it is possible to have without blocking some measurements.
2) On the legend itself, just put the age range, instead of "Old People" and "Young People".
3) The axis labels and title should be bigger.  Maybe consider changing the text to "Days of Month (Sep 2014)" instead of "Days" so it is completely obvious.

Other than that, this is a good graph.  I like the use of error bars, and the color scheme makes the difference very clear.  Great job!
